# Suitability of Augmented Teaching - Physics Tracker
# Overview
Found here is an installable APK as well as the source code for the 
Physics Tracker classroom activity developed by Oscar Mahon 
with assistance from Dr Marie Boden at the University of Queensland
during final year Thesis studies in ENGG4811.

# Using the App
## Controls & Features
1. If requested, grant camera access
2. Tap any object, it will appear outlined
   - Note: You'll need to use a color that is relatively unique to its surroundings. I suggest a bright green for the best results.
3. Tap the large "Play" button in the bottom right - this will immediately begin gathering data
4. Throw your object in a bouncing motion within the cameras view
5. Tap the large "Replay" button in the top right - this will begin the Replay Activity using the recorded data
4. Use the scrubbing tool to analyse the recording
   - Make sure to set the diameter of the object you're using for accurate height analytics

# Running the App
## APK Installation
1. You'll need any android device
2. Simply [download the APK from OneDrive](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AnKhMapPVAQZiskjLEIcYGmOXEMFnw?e=q7J602).
3. Head to Files -> Downloads on your device and tap the APK.
   - If required, your device will prompt you for APK install permissions, which you'll need to grant (you can revoke these permissions later if you would like)
4. The app will automatically install itself
   - You can run it from your App Search Drawer by looking for "Physics Tracker"
   - Please note, 3rd Party APK's can be buggy at times on newer devices. 
The "Replay Scene" application may show up when you search for "Physics Tracker" by text. 
If this occurs, you'll need to scroll to find the app, as launching this "Replay Scene" app on its own will not work.
